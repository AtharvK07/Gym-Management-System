//The provided HTML document creates a webpage titled "Fee Structure." It incorporates a simple structure with a header section containing the title, an embedded stylesheet, and a script to disable the right-click context menu. The body of the webpage includes a styled box with an image. The title, set by the `<title>` tag in the `<head>` section, is "Fee Structure."
//The embedded stylesheet, defined within the `<style>` tags, introduces a CSS rule for a class named "box." The rule specifies that elements with the "box" class should be displayed as blocks and have padding of 12 pixels at the top and bottom, as well as 120 pixels on the left and right.
//The script inside the `<script>` tags uses JavaScript to prevent the default context menu from appearing when the user right-clicks on the webpage. This is achieved by listening for the 'contextmenu' event and calling `event.preventDefault()` to suppress the default behavior.
//The body of the webpage contains a `<div>` element with the class "box." This div encloses an `<img>` tag that displays an image named "Fee Structure.png." The image has specified dimensions of 1100 pixels in width and 500 pixels in height.
//In summary, the HTML document defines a straightforward webpage with a title, a styled box containing an image, and a script to disable right-click functionality, possibly used to protect the image or prevent users from accessing the context menu. The styling ensures a visually appealing presentation of the image within the designated box on the webpage.*/
